In this Lab2 i followed some of the part 2 instructions adding the rendom spawn for the sheeps and the action of the heart 
when they get hit. 
Also I added a little modification where the sheeps rotate when they die 
in addition to the action of shrinking (falling in their left side) and when they 
reach the end falling head-on.
